This is a Program that implements the classic CKY algorithm for syntactic parsing. CKY algorithm is a dynamic algorithm to eﬃciently ﬁnd the most likely syntactic parse tree for a sentence. 

 Compile and Execution Instructions:
 1. I have used python 2.7
 2. Follow the below Steps –  
         -> Unzip the file. 
         -> cd into this folder
         -> Run command: python CKY.py grammar_rules.txt sents.txt 
         -> Output will get printed on the terminal
         -> Output – 2 things                 
                a. All ﬁnal and intermediate probabilities generated during the parsing process                 
                b. Extra – print level order traversal of the tree
